The e-commerce store includes product catalog with search/filtering, product detail pages, shopping cart with persistence, checkout flow with validation, admin panel with full CRUD operations, fairsart branding throughout, sophisticated artisan visual theme with warm earth tones and serif typography, and proper image asset management. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the file evidence.",
