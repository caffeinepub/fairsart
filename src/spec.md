# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create an e-commerce store for fairsart with product catalog, shopping cart, checkout, and admin management.

**Planned changes:**
- Build product catalog page displaying all products with images, names, prices, and descriptions in a grid layout with search/filter capability
- Implement product detail pages showing full information, larger images, and add-to-cart functionality
- Create shopping cart system for adding products, adjusting quantities, and viewing totals with persistence across navigation
- Build checkout flow collecting customer information (name, email, shipping address) and processing orders with validation and confirmation
- Create admin panel for managing products (add, edit, delete) with image upload capability, protected by Internet Identity authentication
- Design sophisticated artisan aesthetic with warm earth tones (terracotta, cream, sage, warm browns), elegant serif typography for headings, and clean layouts with generous whitespace
- Display "fairsart" store name prominently in header and throughout the application
- Include generated store logo, hero banner, and product placeholder images

**User-visible outcome:** Users can browse products, view details, add items to cart, and complete checkout. Admins can manage the product catalog through a protected admin panel. The store presents an elegant, artisanal brand identity for fairsart.
